# navigating_robot

##Introduction
Here is how to make an obstacle detecting/avoiding simple robot using ultrasonic distance sensors, DC motors and an Arduino Uno. The robot navigates itself by using the ultrasonic sensors to determine the distance from potential objects in front and when they are close enough it plays a sound and turns to a different direction and continues moving. All of the robot movement is graphed on a (x,y) plane using matplotlib in python.
